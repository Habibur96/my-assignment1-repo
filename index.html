            </div>

            <p>My dream is to become a problem solber and participate competitive programming contest. Such as ICPC,
                Google Cod
                etc. To become a well problem solver obviously I have to know algorithm, data structure, math. In this
                year ICPC
                regional contest will be held. I have to participate this year. So, my targer is to reach at least top
                10 in
                Dhaka site regional contest.

                <p>Google Code Jam is an annual programming competition in which participants are asked to solve complex
                    algorithmic challenges in a limited amount of time. Programmers can use the programming language of
                    their choice. This contest starts online and programmers can practice by trying out problems from
                    past years.
